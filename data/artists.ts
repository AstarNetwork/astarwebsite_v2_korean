      "Kerri is planning to mint 10,000 NFTs, taking into account the opinions of Astar Network to design the artwork according to the Japanese Web3 ecosystem and market characteristics. The previous NFT project, which MetaKongz team managed on behalf of her, may seem abandoned, but due to her dedicated fan base, they still eagerly await her new updates without much complaint. We expect this collaboration with Astar to be beneficial in terms of utility, not only for the existing fans but also for the new users joining in the future. The estimated timeline for this project is approximately one month.",

He graduated from Dankook University's Communication Design program in 2023 and is currently trying out various works that are not limited to digital but are based on manual labor.",
    interview:
      "The artist Hwang Yong-ha hasn't shown much interest in NFT issuance recently. However, he agrees with Rhee's opinion that his artworks are most similar to the PFP style, and non-square pieces can also be easily customized into PFP style. Since this minting event marks Hwang Yong-ha's first Web3 project, instead of submitting new artworks, the plan is to create 3D versions of the existing collections or provide various variations to transform them into PFP style. (Currently, due to his tighty schedule, creating new artworks is challenging for him.)",

We reinterpreted a painting by Jungin's oldest, Jo Eun, and created a music video that tells the story of a boy and girl's dream adventure. Parents are like the sun and moon to their children, giving them a bright and positive outlook on a dark and scary world. The scene in the music video where Jungin and Jo Jungchi appear as the sun and moon was intended to be humorous, as it was composited from real footage. From this scene on, the suspense disappears, and just as the children are no longer afraid of the monsters but enjoy them, I hope that the viewers of the music video will finish the video with a smile on their face.",

      "Artist Ddangking, who founded the DeBulls NFT-based education platform, has already experienced success on the Klaytn network by issuing 333 NFTs, each valued at $200, and all sold-out in a day. The platform's community is currently active and thriving, with most of the members' activities taking place off-chain. Therefore, there are no objections to NFT migration, but for any strategy of reissuing NFTs on the Astar network, there needs to be sufficient justification, which will be discussed and defined in collaboration with the Astar team. \n\nCurrently, DeBulls' community consists of around 1000 members, mainly in the age range of 40-60. As an education platform, members participate in classes to explore their own expertise, and such metadata representing their skills to be embedded in the NFTs. Ultimately, the goal is to transform the education platform into a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).",

      "Topcy has experience working with Klaytn's official NFT outsourcing company and has conducted NFT projects in the past. He doesn’t believe in the permanent utility of NFTs, so he didn't manage a separate community for his NFT sales. However, despite the abundance of mediocre PFP artworks during that time, his Guitar PFP, which he painstakingly created, stood out with its intricate design. They were not only sold-out instantly, but also gained recognition for its artistic value, earning love from many people until now. \n\nAnother strength of him is being quite proficient in both Japanese and English languages. Additionally, he is highly interested in Generative AI techs/tools, which allows him to produce a large number of artworks without compromising their value.",

    interview:
      "Kim Jandi's adorable characters seem unsuitable for the emojis we typically see on KakaoTalk/LINE Messenger, and I believe they are more suitable for PFP projects. With her prior NFT minting experience, she focused on increasing the exposure of their works and considers the project to have achieved its goals to some extent. \n\nThere hasn't been any experience of listing artworks for sale, as the primary intention was simply to promote herself as an artist. In current challenging market situation, she adopted a conservative approach to avoid creating unsold cases. \n\nAlthough expressing her thoughts logically in English is somewhat limited, she often uses ChatGPT to prepare for the scripts for English AMAs. \n\nIf the collaboration project with Astar succeeds, she is interested in using the funds raised to pursue a merchandise project. One of the key strengths of Kim Jandi is being both an artist and a digital content creator, with each artwork having its own distinct universe. This ability allows them to deliver compelling storytelling to any audience.",

However, considering the difference between a large corporation's NFT project and Kim Mina's artworks, the utility aspect might be relatively limited for her NFTs.

He finds interesting in drawing inspiration from the desires of ancient temples, as well as visualizing universal emotions of human existence through his artworks. \n\nFor a potential collaboration with the Astar Network, Moon Seong-woong is considering using 12 patterns of stone images and combining them with four natural elements like 'fire' and 'water', etc,. to create 36 variations for minting NFTs. This innovative approach will showcase his creativity and unique artistic perspective to the Astar community. \n\nAdditionally, the artist recently launched his own YouTube channel focusing on digital nomad life-related content. By promoting the NFT minting event on their personal channel and, conversely, attracting traffic to his youtube channel through the event, Moon Seong-woong would like to create a synergies to boost his reputation as an artist.
